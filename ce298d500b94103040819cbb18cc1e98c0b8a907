I `require` only what I need. If you want more package, require `sensiolabs/insight` and other packages you want in your application.

@lyrixx That's exactly the purpose of this PR, requiring **less**, not **more** ;)

I'm confused - this PR isn't adding anything, it's actually removing the parts of Guzzle that you're not using...

@lyrixx ``guzzle/guzzle`` is the full guzzle framework. what you are doing currently is equivalent to requiring ``symfony/symfony`` when all you need is ``symfony/http-foundation``
